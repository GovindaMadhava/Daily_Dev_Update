Everyday log of my progress for the Audacity Open Source code contribution journey

Jan 23 2025 Thursday: I decide to start my journey with Audacity. I read blogs appreciating the level to which an idea started by 2 CMU students can reach, all through sheer open source contributions. I was able to find the active projects but the guide states it would be difficult to understand a 20+ year codebase. So I decide to narrow down the scope to just rectify open P4 and P5 issues.

Jan 24 Friday: 
Setup Audacity repo on local machine + successfully built on XCode (Sonoma 14 Mac Target OS deployment). 

Choose issue #7154. Understood the PlotSpectrumBase.h and PlotSpectrumBase.cpp files. It led me to FreqWindow.h and FreqWindow.cpp where the dialog box color and text attributes lie. Need to understand this to make changes.

Jan 30 Thursday: 

Not able to run Audacity app from the local machine repo. No code changes are implemented. Tried re-installing version 3.5.4

Jan 31 Friday:

Going through YT tutorials on how to fork open source repos and implement changes.

Went through 1 latest merge request on Audacity repo: studied how they approach a problem, the code changes they suggest, the level of problems that are attempted.
