Everyday log of my progress for the Audacity Open Source code contribution journey

Jan 23 2025 Thursday: I decide to start my journey with Audacity. I read blogs appreciating the level to which an idea started by 2 CMU students can reach, all through sheer open source contributions. I was able to find the active projects but the guide states it would be difficult to understand a 20+ year codebase. So I decide to narrow down the scope to just rectify open P4 and P5 issues.

Jan 24 Friday: Setup Audacity repo on local machine + successfully built on XCode (Sonoma 14 Mac Target OS deployment). 
Choose issue #7154. Understood the PlotSpectrumBase.h and PlotSpectrumBase.cpp files. It led me to FreqWindow.h and FreqWindow.cpp where the dialog box color and text attributes lie. Need to understand this to make changes.
